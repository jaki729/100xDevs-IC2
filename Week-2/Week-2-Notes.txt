// Async funstions
JS thread does not have access to everything immediately
There are some tasks it needs to wait for
Example:
reading a file
sending a network requests
a deliberate timeout
Event-loop: A single-threaded event loop that handles all the asynchronous operations. It waits for events from different sources (file, network...) and executes callback

The cases that uses asynchronous call mostly other than that use synchronous call
1. Do a network call
2. Read a file and send the content in response
3. Sleep/wait for some time
4. Database call

Delegation of the task in one thread once the task is delegated then it uses another thread

Await:
- It waits until the promise resolves or rejects
- It returns control back to the caller
- If the Promise gets resolved, Await will return the value from the Promise
- If the Promise got rejected, await will throw an error
